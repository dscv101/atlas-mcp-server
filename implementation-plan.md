### Success Criteria
1. All 15 MCP tools function identically to current implementation
2. All MCP resources maintain same URI patterns and data formats
3. Database schema preserves all relationships and constraints
4. Search functionality matches current capabilities
5. Backup/restore maintains data integrity
6. Performance equals or exceeds current implementation
7. Single-process deployment (no Docker required)
